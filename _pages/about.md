Hi, this is 祝君/Jun Zhu. I am currently a final year Ph.D student under the supervision of [Prof. Céline Hudelot](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=gFlAh6MAAAAJ&hl=fr) in CentraleSupélec at Paris-Saclay University. 



My research involves using Artificial Intelligence techniques to optimize the recruitment process. I am particularly interested in recommender systems, data mining, information retrieval, and graph analysis.


Now, I am looking for a job as a data scientist or research engineer, etc., including but not limited to NLP.
